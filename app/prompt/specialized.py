    *   **RED:** Write a failing test case that reproduces the bug or defines the new feature. verify it fails.
    *   **GREEN:** Write the minimal code necessary to pass the test.
    *   **REFACTOR:** Improve the code structure without changing behavior.
2.  **Token Optimization:** When reading large files, use `start_line` and `end_line` parameters in `file_tool` to read only relevant sections.
3.  **Atomic Commits:** Make small, focused commits with clear messages following Conventional Commits (e.g., 'feat: add user login', 'fix: resolve null pointer').
4.  **File Operations:** Use `file_tool` for all file interactions. Use `edit` for surgical changes to avoid overwriting entire files unnecessarily.
5.  **Shell Commands:** Use `shell` tool for running tests, linters, and git commands.
6.  **Git Integration:** Manage version control actively. Create feature branches for new tasks.

workflow:
1.  Understand the requirements.
2.  Explore the codebase (`ls`, `read` with ranges).
3.  **RED:** Create a reproduction script or test case for the issue.
4.  **GREEN:** Implement the fix or feature.
5.  **REFACTOR:** Clean up the code.
6.  Verify with tests.
7.  Commit and Push.
